The International Programme Committee of the 2025 European Association for Health and Information Libraries (EAHIL) Workshop is pleased to announce the call for abstracts is now open. We invite the vibrant EAHIL Community to submit a 500-word abstract for continuing educational courses and workshops, as well as for oral and 3-minute presentations. The call for abstracts will close on 3 November 2024. As you probably heard, the next EAHIL event will take place in a post-industrial city in the heart of Poland, Lodz. The EAHIL 2025 Workshop is an amazing opportunity to explore its potential and get to know our local background better. Our main theme, IMAGINE, consists of 7 letters each representing keywords that you might want to explore while preparing your submission: Inform, Manage, AI, Grow, Integrate, Network, Explore. Make sure to choose one leading keyword and at most two additional ones that your proposal is inspired by. The interpretation of these themes, however, is up to you!
