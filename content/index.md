# European Association for Health Information and Libraries

### Welcome to EAHIL

Health and illness know no frontiers. The sciences that investigate them are the least affected by cultural variations. The systems for delivering health care in different countries of Europe have more common features than differences, despite political and economic influences.
European medical librarians and information specialists have a great deal in common, regardless of the institution they work for or the country they live in. This realization led to the formation of EAHIL to improve library services to the health professions by cooperation and shared experience across national boundaries.

### About
The European Association for Health Information and Libraries is an active association uniting librarians and information professionals working in medical and health science libraries in Europe.

EAHIL supports professional development, improves cooperation and enables exchanges of experience amongst its members, through a yearly meeting in the form of a workshop or a conference, the journal, via the elective member discussion email lists (EAHIL-LIST and lists of SIGs) and through various accounts on social media.

#### A short history of EAHIL
In December 1984 a group of health librarians first discussed plans to initiate contacts with their colleagues in other European countries.

During the Fifth International Congress of Medical Librarianship in 1985 the 26 European colleagues present in Tokyo met to discuss place and date of a first conference which was to gather health information officers and librarians from all countries of Europe. The meeting concluded with the decision to hold such a conference in Brussels a year later.

The First European Conference of Medical Libraries was held in Brussels 1986. Participants acknowledged the need for greater cooperation in Europe so the European Association for Health Information and Libraries (EAHIL) was established.

EAHIL was constituted 1987, in Brighton U.K. Mr Marc Walckiers, Director of the Bibliothèque de la Faculté de Médecine, Université Catholique de Louvain in Brussels, served as EAHIL’s first President.
